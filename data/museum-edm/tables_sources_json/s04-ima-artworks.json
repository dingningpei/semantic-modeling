		"galleryLabel":"Born in Pennsylvania, Benjamin West studied painting in Rome in his early twenties and moved to England in 1763, where he remained for the rest of his career. The setting for this landscape is the Queen's Lodge in the Great Park at Windsor, where woodcutters are shown making a clearing to provide a 'view.' Such vistas were an essential part of 18th-century English landscape design. The landscape was painted the same year West began work on a major cycle of decorations for the chapel at Windsor Castle.",
